Tech3D — Sample Game Builds (10 demos)
-------------------------------------

Each folder contains a small playable demo or placeholder that you can upload to static hosting (Netlify, Vercel, S3 + CloudFront, GitHub Pages).

How to use:
1. Download and unzip the package.
2. For local testing, run a local server in the unzipped directory, e.g.:
   python -m http.server 8000
   Then open http://localhost:8000/game1-orbit-collector/index.html
3. To integrate with your main launcher, point the iframe src to each game's index.html (hosted URL).
4. For production: use a CDN, compress assets, and add CSP headers. Do NOT place AdSense inside the iframe content.

If you want, I can create a zip file and provide it for download.
